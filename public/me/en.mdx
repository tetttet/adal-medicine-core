  My name is Zaisan Kuangan. I am the founder of Adal Medicine. My journey into medicine began in childhood — I often saw my mother struggling with illness. Later, we learned about her congenital heart failure. That was when I first felt the desire not only to observe, but to understand and help.

## My Story

My path into medicine began long before professional decisions and career plans.  
I grew up in an environment where health issues were never abstract — conversations about treatment, examinations, and doctors were part of daily life because illness was always close to our family.

I was raised in one of Kazakhstan’s industrial cities, where medicine was seen as a vital necessity, not simply a “service sector.”

### The Moment That Changed Everything

My mother’s illness — **congenital heart failure** — became an experience impossible to ignore.  
It was years of observation, anxiety, and inner tension. That was when the first conscious desire appeared — not just to empathize, but to understand:

- Why does this happen?  
- Is it possible to change anything?  
- What if we look deeper?

Over time, medicine became a **personal story** for me — not a profession for status, but a responsibility.  
I realized early on: in difficult moments, there must be someone nearby who truly knows what they are doing.

## Searching for Meaning and Choosing a Profession

As I grew older, that inner desire turned into a search for meaning. Medicine became not just an interest, but a way to take responsibility for someone else’s pain.

I understood that the path of a doctor is not about quick decisions or loud promises, but years of:

- education,  
- doubt,  
- practice,  
- continuous development.

The choice of profession was conscious. I entered medicine not for status, but to be useful where a person is most vulnerable.

This stage shaped my approach: to see the patient as a whole — understanding not only the diagnosis, but also **their story, fears, and expectations**.

---

## Education and the Formation of Thinking

My professional development took place within the system of classical medical education, where discipline, responsibility, and clinical thinking are built step by step.

It was during this period that I realized something essential:  
**Medicine is not just a set of knowledge — it is a way of thinking.**

The foundation of my approach became the ability to:

- analyze and compare different approaches,  
- foresee the consequences of each decision,  
- take responsibility for every step.

## A New Experience: A Different Level of Medicine

Moving to **Istanbul** became a turning point. Here, I saw medicine from a different perspective — more technological, highly specialized, and focused on precision.

During my studies and exam preparation, I increasingly encountered patients coming for treatment from Kazakhstan (including Karaganda). Many of them felt confused and lost.

### What Patients Face Abroad

People often do not understand:

- how to choose a doctor,  
- whom to trust,  
- why the same diagnosis may lead to different treatment paths.

Sometimes patients become victims of misinformation and unprofessional guidance — which leads to loss of time, strength, and hope.

---

## People, Patients, and Responsibility

When similar challenges affected my own relatives, they turned to me. I began assisting them: communicating with doctors, analyzing diagnoses, helping select specialists.

Gradually, support extended beyond my personal circle — more and more people began to reach out.

And I clearly saw: often, what a patient lacks is not medicine itself, but a **person** who will:

- help navigate a complex system,  
- explain why a particular decision is made,  
- stay by their side at every stage.

## The Birth of ADAL MEDICINE and Its Philosophy

Comparing the approaches of Kazakhstan and Turkey, I became increasingly convinced:  
**treatment outcomes directly depend on choosing the right doctor.**

In Turkey, each medical field requires narrow specialization, and a mistake in choosing a specialist can cost too much — time, health, and trust.

That is how **ADAL MEDICINE** was born — as a response to a real patient need.

### What We Do

Our philosophy is simple and honest:

- to help people find the **right doctor**, not just “treatment”;  
- to build guidance **transparently and professionally**;  
- to be present not only in words, but at every stage of the journey.

### Results

- **Since 2018**, we have helped **more than 1000** people go through their treatment journey.  
- We build support based on trust, responsibility, and respect.

## What I Believe In

Today, **ADAL MEDICINE** reflects my life path and values.  
For me, medicine is:

- **trust**,  
- **responsibility**,  
- **respect** for every individual.

I sincerely believe that the right doctor can change not only the course of treatment — but life itself.
