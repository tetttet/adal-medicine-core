## Oncology Treatment in Turkey

An oncology diagnosis is a situation where it is crucial not to lose time and to gain access to modern treatment.

Throughout our work, more than **600 patients** with oncological diseases have contacted us to organize treatment in Turkey and were able to find solutions even in complex cases where options were limited in other countries.

For many patients, treatment in Turkey has become a chance to preserve and prolong life.

## Why Turkey?

Turkey, especially Istanbul, is now one of the leading centers for oncology treatment.

Here, the following are applied:

- International treatment protocols  
- Modern diagnostic technologies  
- The latest medications  
- Individualized therapy programs  

In many CIS countries, such methods are either unavailable or require long waiting periods.

## Modern Diagnostics

Patients have access to high-precision examination methods:

- PET-CT  
- Computed Tomography (CT)  
- Next-generation Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)  

This makes it possible to accurately determine the stage of the disease and choose an effective treatment strategy.

- New-generation chemotherapy  
- Immunotherapy
