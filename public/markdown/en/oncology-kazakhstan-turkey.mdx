## Why We Work Specifically with Turkish Medicine

Turkey is today one of the fastest-growing countries in the medical sector.

Here, modern technologies, international treatment protocols, experienced doctors, and a well-organized system for international patients come together.

Treatment in Turkey means not only high-quality medicine, but also speed, organization, and a clear patient pathway: from the first contact to the start of treatment, minimal time passes — which is especially critical in serious diagnoses.

We work across all medical fields — from oncology and cardiology to neurosurgery, orthopedics, reproductive health, and plastic surgery.

Our mission is to help each patient reach the right clinic and the right doctor who can truly help.

## The Story Behind the Project

The foundation of our team began with the personal journey of **Zaisan Kuangan**, physician and project founder.

After coming to Turkey and seeing the healthcare system from the inside, he personally realized how different the organization of treatment, doctors’ approach, and speed of decision-making are compared to what patients from CIS countries often experience.

He saw how in Turkey:

- diagnostics are performed quickly  
- patients are not lost between clinics and specialists  
- treatment begins without unnecessary delays  
- doctors guide the patient as a whole, not just individual test results  

It became clear: people need not just access to a clinic, but a **guide within the system**.
