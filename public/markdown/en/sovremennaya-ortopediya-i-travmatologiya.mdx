## Orthopedic Treatment in Istanbul

Orthopedic treatment in Istanbul begins with precise diagnostics: in orthopedics, it is important to determine not only the area of pain but also its true cause. Clinics use next-generation MRI and CT imaging, allowing detailed assessment of joints, cartilage, ligaments, and the spine.

Based on examination results, an individualized treatment plan is created, taking into account the degree of damage and the patient’s lifestyle.

## Diagnostics

Modern imaging helps accurately identify the source of pain and choose the optimal treatment strategy:

- Next-generation MRI and CT  
- Assessment of joints, ligaments, and cartilage tissue  
- Diagnosis of spinal disorders and neurological causes of pain

## Treatment Approach

Whenever possible, preference is given to conservative and minimally invasive methods. This includes modern injection therapies aimed at reducing inflammation, restoring mobility, and slowing joint degeneration.

For meniscus, ligament, and cartilage injuries, arthroscopic surgery is widely used — a minimally invasive procedure performed through small incisions that helps preserve healthy tissue and speed up recovery.

## Surgical Methods

In cases of advanced degenerative joint changes, joint replacement (endoprosthesis) is performed using modern implants. Implants are selected individually and are designed for long-term durability. Such procedures help restore natural biomechanics and significantly reduce pain.

Treatment of spinal disorders in Istanbul is based on gentle surgical techniques and precise stabilization, which in many cases helps avoid extensive operations and prolonged rehabilitation.

## Treatment Goal

The approach used in Istanbul’s orthopedic centers is focused not only on pain relief but also on restoring musculoskeletal function — enabling patients to return to an active life with sustainable results.
