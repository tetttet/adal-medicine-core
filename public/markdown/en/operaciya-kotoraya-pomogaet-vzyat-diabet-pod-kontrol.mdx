## A surgery that helps bring diabetes under control

Modern medicine offers **metabolic surgery** — a surgical treatment for type 2 diabetes aimed not only at weight loss, but also at normalizing metabolism and blood sugar levels.

After surgery, many patients experience:

- blood sugar levels returning to normal
- reduced need for — or complete discontinuation of — pills and insulin
- long-term diabetes remission

---

## What kind of surgery is this?

A **metabolic operation** is a surgical intervention on the stomach and intestines that:

- changes the body’s hormonal response
- reduces insulin resistance
- improves pancreatic function

> **Important:** the effect is achieved not only through weight loss, but mainly due to hormonal changes.

### Most commonly used methods:

- Gastric bypass
- Sleeve gastrectomy (Sleeve)
- Combined metabolic procedures

The type of operation is selected individually after an examination.

---

## Who is this surgery for?

Metabolic surgery may be recommended for patients:

- with type 2 diabetes
- with poor blood sugar control
- with pronounced insulin resistance
- with excess weight or obesity
- when medication does not provide the needed effect

> The decision is made only after reviewing tests and specialist consultations.

---

## What tests are needed?

For a preliminary assessment, the following are usually required:

- HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin)
- Blood glucose
- Insulin and C-peptide
- BMI (height and weight)
- Liver and kidney function tests
- Cardiology evaluation
- Diabetes treatment history

> Some tests can be done in your home country before arrival.
