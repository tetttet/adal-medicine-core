# CASE 2

## “Your Child Will Never Walk Again”

These were the words spoken not just by a patient — but by my former classmate.

Her child had been diagnosed with cerebral palsy (CP),  
and the medical forecasts were becoming increasingly discouraging:  
with age, the condition was expected to worsen.

The family went through confusion, fear, and a deep sense of helplessness.  
When you are told there is no chance, it is incredibly difficult to believe that another path may still exist.

However, in Istanbul, thanks to carefully selected treatment and a comprehensive multidisciplinary approach, something happened that almost no one believed in anymore.

A detailed diagnostic assessment was performed,  
an individualized rehabilitation plan was developed,  
and specialized physicians along with neuromotor therapy experts were involved.

Gradually, results began to appear.  
Step by step — small but deeply meaningful victories.

This case became proof that even with severe diagnoses, one prognosis should never be the final word.  
Modern medicine and a systematic approach can change the trajectory.

Sometimes the most important thing is finding the right place, the right team — and refusing to give up.
