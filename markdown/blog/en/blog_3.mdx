# CASE 3

## A Small Spot on a Finger Led to Amputation

It all started with a small spot on a finger.

At first glance, it did not appear alarming. An incorrect diagnosis was made, and valuable time was lost.

As the symptoms began to progress, it became clear that the situation was far more serious.  
Ultimately, the patient required finger amputation.

After the patient contacted us and underwent a repeated comprehensive diagnostic evaluation, it was revealed that the underlying cause was an oncological disease — one that could have been detected much earlier with the right approach and thorough examination.

This case serves as a reminder of how important it is not to ignore even minor changes in the body and to seek a second opinion when in doubt.

Timely diagnosis and attention to detail can play a decisive role.
