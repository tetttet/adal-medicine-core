# CASE 1  
## An Unplanned Hysterectomy Was Required During Surgery

![Patient](/images/content/case_1.png)

---

## Clinical Situation

The patient was diagnosed with **oncological disease**.  
Prior to surgery, all necessary evaluations were completed:

- Comprehensive laboratory testing  
- Instrumental diagnostics  
- Consultations with specialized physicians  
- Preoperative preparation  

Despite careful planning, the final extent of surgical intervention was determined **only during the operation itself**.

---

## Why Can the Surgical Plan Change?

In oncologic surgery, final decisions are often made intraoperatively due to:

- The extent of tumor spread  
- Involvement of adjacent tissues  
- Intraoperative findings  
- The need for radical removal of the lesion  

> In this case, to ensure oncological safety, a decision was made to perform an unplanned hysterectomy.

The primary goal was **complete removal of the pathological process and reduction of recurrence risk**.

## Outcome

The surgery was successful.  
The patient received the necessary treatment volume according to international protocols.

Postoperative recovery is under specialist supervision.  
The condition is stable.

---

## Important

Each clinical case is individual.  
In oncology, the main priorities are:

- Patient safety  
- Radical treatment  
- Minimizing complication risks  
- Recurrence control  

Therefore, in some situations, the surgical extent may be expanded based on vital indications.
